This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Design is based on: https://www.figma.com/file/L7JBy7VDsQRg2BMAmaUi0r/Web-Design-Practice-(Community)?type=design&node-id=20-11&mode=design&t=96msp0aOpaC9h4kV-0

Both dark and light mode is implemented as well as responsive version of the website.

Elements of the design are interactive, not only placeholders.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
